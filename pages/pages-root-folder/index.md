  text: 'Ustaad Surjeet Singh is a <em>Sarangi</em> player based in the UK. He is a student of Pundit Ram Narayan Ji. Pundit Ram Narayan ji popularized the sarangi as a solo concert instrument and became the first internationally successful sarangi player.</br></br>
        Born in Delhi in 1961, Ustad Surjeet Singh was initiated into Indian Classical Music by <em>Satguru Jagjit Singh of the NaamDhari panth</em>. 
        &nbsp;At Bhaini Sahib, Ustad Surjeet Singh was trained in the playing of the Dilruba by <em>Ustad Gurdev Singh</em> and <em>Ustad Harbhajan Singh</em>, both of whom are now based in the UK.
        &nbsp;He later received training in vocal but his love of the enchanting sound of the Sarangi led him to the great deity of the Sarangi, Pundit Ram Narayan in 1977. &nbsp;He spent the next 15 years of his life in training under Pundit ji. 
        In recent years, Ustaad Surjeet Singh received guidance from <em>Pundit Hanuman Prasad Mishra (Banaras Gharana).</em> </br></br>
        Ustad ji can be often found performing at various concerts worldwide and shares the blessings that were given to him throughout his training with his students. 
        Ustad ji&#39;s technical mastery coupled with his traditional approach has won him admiration throughout the world. His proficiency in the art of <em>Khayal</em> and <em>Thumri</em> has led him to attract praise from the music world and the uninitiated alike. </br></br>
        Ustad ji has played extensively throughout India at various important festivals giving solo recitals as well as accompanying leading musicians such as <em>Ustad Salamat Ali Khan</em>, <em>Ustad Fateh Ali Khan</em>, <em>Pundit Rajan & Sajan Mishra</em> and <em>Shiri L K Pundit</em> amongst others. 
        He is also a recognised and graded artist of <em>All India Radio</em>. Ustad Surjeet Singh has played at numerous venues in Thailand, East Africa, Europe and America.
        His music has appeared in the British media providing background music for various television programmes on Channel 4.</br></br>
