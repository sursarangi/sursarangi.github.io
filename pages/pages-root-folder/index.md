  text: 'Ustad Surjeet Singh is a <em>Sarangi</em> player based in the UK. He is a student of Pundit Ram Narayan Ji. Pundit Ram Narayan ji popularized the sarangi as a solo concert instrument and became the first internationally successful sarangi player.</br></br>
        Born in Delhi in 1961, Ustad Surjeet Singh was initiated into Indian Classical Music by <em>Satguru Jagjit Singh of the Naamdhari panth</em>. 
        &nbsp;At Bhaini Sahib, Ustad Surjeet Singh was trained in the playing of the Dilruba by <em>Ustad Gurdev Singh</em> and <em>Ustad Harbhajan Singh</em>, both of whom are now based in the UK.
        &nbsp;He later received training in vocal but his love of the enchanting sound of the Sarangi led him to the great deity of the Sarangi, Pundit Ram Narayan in 1977. &nbsp;He spent the next 15 years of his life in training under Pundit ji. 
        In recent years, Ustad Surjeet Singh received guidance from <em>Pundit Hanuman Prasad Mishra (Banaras Gharana).</em>'
